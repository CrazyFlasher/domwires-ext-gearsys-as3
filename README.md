##DomWires-Extensions-GearSys
Pattern (especially for games), that makes your application logic to be similar to constructor.

**IGearSysMechanism** forces **IGearSys** to "spin". **IGearSys** can have as many **IGearSysObjects** as needed, which will be "spinned"
 by **IGearSys**.
Each **IGearSysObject** can have several (unlimited) **IGearSysComponents**, which will be "spinned" by parent **IGearSysObject**.

**Soon I'll add an example and update AsDoc to see how to use it and how it works.**
